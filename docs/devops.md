# What are the core DevOps responsibilities we normally carry?

When it comes to DevOps, we always picture the infinity symbol in our minds. It contains Dev, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor as the main steps for a CI/CD pipeline. As a DevOps Engineer, we're CI/CD oriented and we take responsibilities in each step of the pipeline.

From my point of view, the core DevOps responsibilities we normally carry are:

- Maintaining CI/CD pipelines
- Automation implementation
- On-call, incident response and incident management
- Monitoring

**Maintaining CI/CD pipelines**

Being part of a DevOps team, we have a responsibility for building a CI/CD pipeline and optimizing processes, people and tooling. We should constantly improve the pipeline – from people to processes.

**Automation implementation**

Implementation of automation improve the efficiency. By constantly automating mundane tasks, we’re able to focus more on strategic development and driving business value.

**On-call, incident response and incident management**

With shared accountability and code ownership, a DevOps team need to take on-call responsibilities and incident management work. We learn more about our systems by responding to incidents in production. As a concequence, we will write code that better fits into our applications and infrastructure — resulting in fewer incidents.

**Monitoring**

Last but not least, DevOps teams are responsible for the implementation of actionable monitoring solutions. It’s very important for building reliable systems.


As for me, I am good at **Automation** and **Monitoring**, because I always want to build up the pipelines to make the system run smoothly, and also, I want to make the most of every part of the hardware to utilise resources.
