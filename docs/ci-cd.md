# CI/CD

In this article, we briefly demonstrate how CI/CD tool will make integration and deployment more efficient and reliable.

Without the CI/CD tools, we are in the world like:

 - Compiling and deploying manually, that means low-efficiency
 - Lacking of transparency, which results in more mistakes
 - Longer delivery lifecycle
 - Less satisfaction from customers

Now, we introduce CI/CD tool with the following requirements:

 - Good branching strategy
 - Clear integration rules set
 - Standardised infrastracture
 - Rapid feedbacks

We will take these advantages from the CI/CD pipelines:

 1. Rapid Continuous Integration
 1. Automatic Testing and Monitoring
 1. Transparency of all the processes
 1. Less mistakes

The CI/CD tool does all the building, testing, monitoring and depoyling for us automatically. With the branching strategy, setting rules and standardized infrastracture, it reduces the mistakes every mankind could have done. On these premises, the CI/CD tool makes integration and deployment more efficient and reliable.
